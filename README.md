# Medknow database access system

Medknow is a Python wrapper for SQL used in the context of a medical application. It is an electronic health record database access script. Too simple to be industry-worthy; it was just a college project. A much improved version was planned for the backend record system in [ONITO](https://onitomed.github.io).
